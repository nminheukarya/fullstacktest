C) Ensures that all requests are handled by a single server  
D) Allows horizontal scaling  
‚úÖ Correct Answer: A, B, D  
üìù Explanation: Load balancers distribute traffic (A), improve fault tolerance (B), and support horizontal scaling (D).  They do not force all requests to a single server (C).

2. Load Balancer: Reverse Proxy vs Load Balancer (True/False)  
A Reverse Proxy can also act as a Load Balancer.  
Load Balancers always distribute traffic based on CPU utilization of backend servers.  
‚úÖ Correct Answers:  
‚úÖ True ‚Äì Many reverse proxies (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy) have load balancing features.  
‚ùå False ‚Äì Load balancers distribute traffic using different algorithms (e.g., round-robin, least connections), not just CPU utilization.  

3. Proxy: Forward vs Reverse Proxy

Example 2:  
Input: nums = [9, 1, 8, 3, 4, 2, 5, 7, 6]  
Output: 9  
Explanation: The longest consecutive sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].

## 2 Open-ended questions, 60 min (60 points)  
### 1. Question: Designing a Scalable and Secure CI/CD Pipeline  
üí° "Your company is developing a microservices-based application using GitLab CI/CD, Docker, and Kubernetes. You need to set up a CI/CD pipeline that ensures high availability, security, and fast deployments. How would you design this pipeline? Explain the technologies you would use and how they interact."  
Scalability of the CI/CD Pipeline: How would you ensure that your CI/CD pipeline can scale as the project grows in terms of multiple microservices, high-volume builds, and multiple developers? (Hint: Consider using tools like GitLab CI, Jenkins, or GitHub Actions for pipeline management. Think about how you would distribute workload using runners, agents, or parallel jobs.)  
Security Best Practices for CI/CD: How would you ensure that the CI/CD pipeline is secure from potential threats, such as credential leaks, malicious code injection, or unauthorized access? (Hint: Think about secret management, access controls, code scanning, and container security.)  
Integration with Version Control and Testing: How would you set up the pipeline to ensure that every commit is automatically tested and validated before deployment? (Hint: Consider automated unit, integration, and end-to-end testing stages. Use testing frameworks and integration with version control like Git.)  
Deployment Strategy for Staging and Production: How would you handle the deployment process to staging and production? (Hint: Look into Blue/Green deployment, Canary deployments, or rolling updates to minimize downtime and risks during deployment.)

Covers most pipeline stages but lacks details on scaling/security.  
Uses Docker and Kubernetes but doesn‚Äôt fully optimize resource management.  
Mentions some security aspects (e.g., container scanning), but lacks depth.  
‚úÖ 5-9 Points:  
Basic pipeline structure without strong CI/CD automation.  
Minimal or no mention of security and scaling strategies.  
‚úÖ 1-4 Points:  
Generic explanation without linking technologies properly.  
  
### 2. Question:  
üí° "You are part of a DevOps team building a private cloud infrastructure to support a SaaS and IaaS platform. Since you cannot use public cloud providers like AWS or Azure, you need to design and manage your own compute, storage, and networking infrastructure. Describe your approach to:  
Compute Resource Management: How would you efficiently manage hardware, virtualization, and containerization? (Hint: Consider using virtualization tools like Proxmox, KVM, or VMware. Think about how you would allocate resources dynamically.)  
Networking & Traffic Handling: How would you design a secure, scalable network with routing, firewalls, and load balancing? (Hint: Consider VLANs, subnets, NAT, and self-hosted load balancers like HAProxy or NGINX.)  
Storage & Data Redundancy: How would you ensure scalable, redundant, and high-performance storage? (Hint: Think about distributed storage solutions like Ceph or GlusterFS and backup strategies.)  
Monitoring & Security: How would you monitor system health and implement security best practices? (Hint: Self-hosted monitoring tools like Prometheus or Zabbix, access control, firewalls, and intrusion detection tools.)  
  
#### Scoring Milestones (Max 20 Points):  
‚úÖ 15-20 Points (Excellent Answer):  
Compute: Uses bare-metal servers or virtualization (Proxmox, KVM, VMware) and implements containerization (Docker, Podman) with orchestration (Nomad, OpenStack, custom solutions).  
Networking: Designs subnet segmentation, VLANs, routing policies, and load balancing (HAProxy, NGINX, Keepalived) with proper firewall rules.  
Storage: Implements distributed storage (Ceph, GlusterFS, RAID, or SAN) and defines backup strategies (incremental snapshots, offsite replication).  
Monitoring & Security: Uses self-hosted monitoring (Prometheus, Zabbix, Nagios) and strong security measures (firewall policies, access controls, IDS/IPS like Suricata, Fail2ban).  
‚úÖ 10-14 Points (Good Answer, Some Gaps):  
Covers compute, networking, and storage, but lacks depth in scalability or security strategies.  
Implements basic network segmentation and a firewall but lacks high availability.  
Mentions storage solutions but lacks detailed backup and redundancy planning.  
Some security considerations but lacks detailed authentication and access control strategy.  
‚úÖ 5-9 Points (Basic Understanding):  
Mentions virtualization but lacks depth on resource allocation or orchestration.  
Has a basic networking setup but does not address routing, security, or redundancy.  
Mentions storage but lacks redundancy or scalability considerations.  
Limited monitoring and security strategies.  
‚úÖ 1-4 Points (Weak Answer):  
No clear plan for compute, networking, or storage.  
No redundancy or high-availability strategy.  
No security or monitoring considerations.
