B) Improves application fault tolerance  
C) Ensures that all requests are handled by a single server  
D) Allows horizontal scaling  
‚úÖ Correct Answer: A, B, D  
üìù Explanation: Load balancers distribute traffic (A), improve fault tolerance (B), and support horizontal scaling (D).  They do not force all requests to a single server (C).

2. Load Balancer: Reverse Proxy vs Load Balancer (True/False)  
A Reverse Proxy can also act as a Load Balancer.  
Load Balancers always distribute traffic based on CPU utilization of backend servers.  
‚úÖ Correct Answers:  
‚úÖ True ‚Äì Many reverse proxies (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy) have load balancing features.  
‚ùå False ‚Äì Load balancers distribute traffic using different algorithms (e.g., round-robin, least connections), not just CPU utilization.  

3. Proxy: Forward vs Reverse Proxy

A forward proxy is typically used to:  
A) Load balance backend servers  
B) Hide client identities from the internet  
C) Improve API response times

C) Can be configured using HTTP response headers  
D) Prevents all cross-origin requests  
‚úÖ Correct Answer: B, C  
üìù Explanation: CORS enables secure cross-origin communication (B) and is configured via HTTP headers (C). It does not prevent all cross-origin requests (D).

## Coding Problem 1: Algorithm ‚Äì Longest Consecutive Sequence  
(Any Coding Language is OK, Console log or command line log display ok)  
‚è≥ Estimated Time: 30 minutes  
üíª Difficulty Level: Medium  
Problem Statement:  
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.  
You must solve it in O(n log n) time complexity.  
The sequence must be continuous in terms of numbers, not indices.  
"longest consecutive" means:  
A sequence of numbers in the array that appear in order without gaps (but not necessarily adjacent in the array).  
The sequence must be incremented by 1 each time.  
Example of "Longest Consecutive Sequence" Meaning  
Valid Consecutive Sequence:  
‚úÖ [1, 2, 3, 4] (Numbers appear in order)  
‚úÖ [100, 101, 102]  
    
Example Input & Output:  
Example 1:  
Input: nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]  
Output: 4  
Explanation: The longest consecutive sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4].  
    
Example 2:  
Input: nums = [9, 1, 8, 3, 4, 2, 5, 7, 6]  
Output: 9  
Explanation: The longest consecutive sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].  
    
Expected Complexity:  
‚úÖ O(n * log n) time complexity
