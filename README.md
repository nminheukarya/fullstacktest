1. Load Balancer: Key Benefits  
(Multi-Choice)  
Which of the following are key benefits of using a Load Balancer?
A) Distributes traffic evenly across multiple servers  
B) Improves application fault tolerance  
C) Ensures that all requests are handled by a single server  
D) Allows horizontal scaling  
‚úÖ Correct Answer: A, B, D  
üìù Explanation: Load balancers distribute traffic (A), improve fault tolerance (B), and support horizontal scaling (D).  They do not force all requests to a single server (C).

2. Load Balancer: Reverse Proxy vs Load Balancer (True/False)  
A Reverse Proxy can also act as a Load Balancer.  
Load Balancers always distribute traffic based on CPU utilization of backend servers.  
‚úÖ Correct Answers:  
‚úÖ True ‚Äì Many reverse proxies (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy) have load balancing features.  
‚ùå False ‚Äì Load balancers distribute traffic using different algorithms (e.g., round-robin, least connections), not just CPU utilization.  

3. Proxy: Forward vs Reverse Proxy  
(Optional - Single Choice)  
A forward proxy is typically used to:  
A) Load balance backend servers  
B) Hide client identities from the internet  
C) Improve API response times  
D) Secure backend microservices  
‚úÖ Correct Answer: B) Hide client identities from the internet

4. Microservices: Best Practices  
(Multi-Choice)  
Which are best practices when designing microservices?

D) Services should communicate via APIs  
‚úÖ Correct Answer: A, B, D  
üìù Explanation: Microservices should have separate databases (A), loose coupling (B), and communicate via   APIs (D). Direct database access between services (C) creates tight coupling.  

5. Monolithic: Disadvantages  
(True/False)  
Monolithic applications are easier to scale than microservices.  
Debugging a monolithic application is usually simpler than debugging microservices.  
‚úÖ Correct Answers:  
‚ùå False ‚Äì Scaling a monolithic app requires upgrading the entire system, which is harder.

B) Authentication  
C) Direct database access  
D) Logging and Monitoring  
‚úÖ Correct Answer: A, B, D  
üìù Explanation: API Gateways provide rate limiting (A), authentication (B), and logging/monitoring (D) but do not access databases directly (C).  

7. API Gateway: Rate Limiting  
(Optional - Single Choice)  
What is the main reason for rate limiting in an API Gateway?  
A) To prevent excessive load on backend services  
B) To improve SEO rankings  
C) To reduce API request latency  
D) To allow more users to send unlimited requests  
‚úÖ Correct Answer: A) To prevent excessive load on backend services  
üìù Explanation: Rate limiting helps control traffic to prevent abuse and overload on backend services.  

8. Caching: Key Benefits  
(Multi-Choice)  
What are benefits of caching?  
A) Faster response times  
B) Lower database load  
C) Always up-to-date data  
D) Reduced API costs  
‚úÖ Correct Answer: A, B, D  
üìù Explanation: Caching speeds up responses (A), reduces database load (B), and saves API costs (D), but may serve stale data (C).  

9. Horizontal Scaling: Challenges  
(True/False)  
Horizontal scaling is harder than vertical scaling because it requires distributing stateful data across multiple nodes.  
Vertical scaling always provides better performance than horizontal scaling.  
‚úÖ Correct Answers:  
‚úÖ True ‚Äì Managing state in horizontal scaling is complex.  
‚ùå False ‚Äì Horizontal scaling is often better for large-scale applications.  
  
10. JWT Authentication: Secure Handling  
(Multi-Choice)  
How should JWTs be securely stored?  
A) Store in HTTP-only cookies  
B) Store in localStorage  
C) Encrypt before storing in a database  
D) Send JWTs over HTTP instead of HTTPS  
‚úÖ Correct Answer: A, C  
üìù Explanation: Store JWTs in HTTP-only cookies (A) and encrypt if stored (C). Never use localStorage (B) due to XSS risks.  
  
11. Websockets: When to Use  
(Optional - Single Choice)  
WebSockets are ideal for which application?  
A) Real-time stock price updates  
B) Static content websites  
C) Periodic batch processing  
D) Database backups  
‚úÖ Correct Answer: A) Real-time stock price updates  
üìù Explanation: WebSockets allow low-latency real-time communication.  
  
12. Rate Limiting: Protection  
(True/False)  
Rate limiting helps prevent DDoS attacks.  
Rate limiting is ineffective if implemented at the API Gateway level.  
‚úÖ Correct Answers:  
‚úÖ True  
‚ùå False ‚Äì API Gateways are effective for rate limiting.  
  
13. CORS: Importance  
(Multi-Choice)  
Which are true about CORS?  
A) Protects against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks  
B) Allows safe communication between different origins  
C) Can be configured using HTTP response headers  
D) Prevents all cross-origin requests  
‚úÖ Correct Answer: B, C  
üìù Explanation: CORS enables secure cross-origin communication (B) and is configured via HTTP headers (C). It does not prevent all cross-origin requests (D).  
  
14. CORS: Browser Behavior  
(True/False)  
CORS is enforced by web browsers, not by backend servers.  
Adding Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * makes an API completely secure.  
‚úÖ Correct Answers:  
‚úÖ True  
‚ùå False ‚Äì * allows any domain to access the API, reducing security.
